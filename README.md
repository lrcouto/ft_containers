# ft_containers
The standard C++ containers have all a specific usage. To make sure we understand them, let’s re-implement them!

For this project at <a href='http://42sp.org.br'> 42 São Paulo</a>, we are expected to re-implement the C++98 versions of the Vector, the Map and the Stack, with the Set as a bonus using a red-black tree.

**July 27th 2022** - Brand new project. Classmates recommended that I start with the vector. I want to use a proper testing framework for this project, because there is a lot of testing to do, so I'm researching that as well.

- Did an initial setup with an older version of the  <a href='https://github.com/doctest/doctest'> doctest</a> framework that runs on C++98. I can at least run tests pretty easily now. Will probably have to make my Makefile not suck in the near future.
